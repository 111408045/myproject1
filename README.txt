	It is an application for a game called tic tac toe.The game can be played between one player and computer.
	This application will run within the terminal window. When the user runs my game, it will show some background of the game. When the user choose to start the game, the game screen will show a box, which contains a number of sub-boxes. The player can't overwrite  in any box. If the player tries to enter his move in the box that's already taken, then screen will show INVALID MOVE. 
	I have added total 6 functions. player_move function will help the player to give an entry in the box he wants to. computer_move function will control the movement of the computer. The function init_matrix will initialize all the boxes of the drawboard. display_matrix will display the game board on screen. THe function rules will show all the rules of the game to the player. The function check will check whether the player is winner after each player move and whether the computer is winner after each computer move. Hence the function check is called after each movement of the game.
